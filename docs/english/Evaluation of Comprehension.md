## Evaluation of Comprehension

**Importance of Evaluation:**  
Evaluation helps the teacher to know whether the teaching methodology adopted was successful or not. It helps the teacher to know how successful students were in learning new skills i.e. LSRW. Evaluation also helps the students to determine which area of learning requires more attention.

**Steps of Evaluation**  
• Determine educational objectives  
• Organize learning experiences 
• Measure behavioral changes  
• Perform tests

**Continuous and Comprehensive Evaluation (CCE):**  
Continuous and Comprehensive Evaluation is a system which was introduced by CBSE in India to assess all aspects of a student’s development on a continuous basis throughout the year. It covers both scholastic subjects as well as co-scholastic areas such as performance in arts, music, dance, sports, athletics and other cultural activities. Some students are not good in academics but can excel in other extracurricular activities.  
• **Continuous** denotes regular and continuous activities conducted throughout the year to achieve all round development.  
• **Comprehensive** suggests mental, emotional and physical aspects of the student’s progress i.e. all round development of the student.  
• **Evaluation** suggests variety of tools and techniques which are used to assess and evaluate the student’s progress.

**Objectives of CCE:**  
Some of the objectives of CCE are as follows  
• To develop cognitive, psychomotor and affective skills.  
• To lay emphasis on thought process and de-emphasize memorization. To make evaluation as integral part of teaching learning process.  
• To use evaluation as a quality control device to maintain desired standard of performance.  
• To make the process of teaching and learning a learner – centered activity.

**Scholastic** aspects include curricular areas or subject specific areas, whereas co-scholastic aspects include life skills, co-curricular activities, attitudes and values.

**Importance of CCE Scheme:**  
It will reduce stress and anxiety which often build up during and after the examination which could have an adverse effect on learners.  
• It will **reduce the dropout rate** as there will be less fear and anxiety.  
• The emphasis on **conceptual clarification** through experimental learning in the classroom will increase.  
• It will help the learners to develop holistically in terms of personality by also focusing on the co – scholastic aspects which will also be assessed.  
• The student will have more time on their hands to develop **their interest, hobbies and personalities.**  
• It will motivate learning in a friendly environment than in the fearful situation.  
• It provides information and helps in making decisions for the future, regarding choice of subjects, courses and careers.

**Formative Assessment:**  
Formative Assessment is a tool to continuously monitor student progress in a non-threatening supportive environment. It involves regular feedback, a chance for student to reflect on the performance and improve upon by taking advice.

**Features of Formative Assessment:**  
• It is diagnostic and remedial.  
• It provides a platform for the active involvement of students in their own learning.  
• It enables teachers to adjust teaching to take account of the results of assessment.  
• It builds on student’s prior knowledge and experience in designing what is taught.  
• It offers an opportunity to students to improve their work after they get the feedback.  
• It helps students to support their peer group and vice-versa.
