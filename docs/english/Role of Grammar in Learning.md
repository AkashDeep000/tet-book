## Role of Grammar in Learning a Language

**Linguistic:** The scientific study of language and its structure, including the study of grammar, syntax, and phonetics.

**Linguists** define grammar as a **set of components**:

1.  **Phonetics:** Phonetics is defined as the study of the sounds of human speech using the mouth, throat, nasal and sinus cavities, and lungs (i.e, production and perception of sounds).

2.  **Phonology:** Phonology is the study of the patterns of sounds in a language and across languages (i.e., how sounds are combined).

3.  **Morphology:** The study of forms or how elements are combined to create words

4.  **Morphemes**: Morphemes are the minimal units of words that have a meaning and cannot be subdivided further.

5.  **Syntax:** how words are strung together into sentences

6.  **Semantics:** Relating to meaning in language or logic.

-   Because all languages are characterized by these components, by definition, language does not exist without grammar.
-   Originally, the term grammar and grammatical referred to the art of writing, as compared to rhetoric and rhetorical, which is the art of speaking.
-   As used today by many teachers and learners, grammar is loosely understood to be a set of rules that govern language, primarily its morphology and syntax. But morphology and syntax are only two components of grammar.
-   Communicative language teaching has brought a renewed emphasis on the role that semantics play in the definition of language.
-   Communicative language teaching is fundamentally concerned with ‘making meaning’ in the language, whether by interpreting someone else’s message, expressing one’s own or negotiating when meaning is unclear.
-   The goal of language learning in the communicative classroom is for learners to acquire the grammar of the second language in its broadest sense, to enable them to understand and make meaning, that is, to become proficient users of the second language.

**1.Explicit grammar instruction (EGI)**:

-   The use of instructional strategies to draw the students’ attention to or focus on form and/or structure.
-   The role of EGI in a second/foreign language class has changed drastically in the last forty years as the favored methodology changed from the grammar-translation to audio-lingual, then from audio-lingual to cognitive, and finally from cognitive to communicative approaches.

**2. The grammar-translation approach:**

-   Grammar-translation approach concentrated on grammar skills, in particular, the ability to use grammatical terminology to describe the various morphological and syntactic principles of the target language.
-   With the advent of audio-lingualism, instructors were not supposed to spend a great deal of time talking directly about target language grammar rules.

**3. Grammar in communicating ideas in written form:**

-   Effective grammar instructions begin with what students already know about grammar, and it helps them to use this knowledge as they write.
-   By connecting their knowledge of oral language to written language, teachers can demystify abstract grammatical terminology so that students can write—and read—with greater competence and confidence.
-   Because writing is a complex and challenging activity for many students, teachers should focus on the grammatical concepts that are essential for the clear communication of meaning.

**4. Grammar is essential for:**

-   Teaching concepts on subject, verb, sentence, clause, phrase, and related concepts for editing.
-   Teaching style though sentence combining and sentence generating.
-   Teaching sentence sense through the manipulation of syntactic elements.
-   Teaching both the power of dialects and the dialects of power.
-   Teaching punctuation and mechanics for convention, clarity and style.
