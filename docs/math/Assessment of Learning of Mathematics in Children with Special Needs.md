## Assessment of Learning of Mathematics in Children with Special Needs

All the assessment tools may not be suitable for children with special needs as their needs may differ from rest of the class. Adaptations and accommodations are required as per the needs of the child and the assessment criteria should be formulated as a teamwork following a discussion and consent of experts, parents and the learners, while conducting assessment of learners with special needs.

These learners may need adaptation in assessment process to find out their current status or to make formative and summative evaluation.

## For Learners with Low Vision:

Low vision learners take more time to complete homework or examination. These learners experience fatigue at the end of the day which may affect the quality of work. Therefore, the following considerations must be remembered:

-   Allow oral exams or a scribe to write examination answers.
-   If asking for examples in an exam, lessen the number of examples needed to be given.
-   Provide extra time to complete the exam.
-   Administer the exam in more than one sitting.
-   Reduce the number of questions to be answered.
-   Question paper that consists of larger print can help low vision learners. A few ways that can enhance the print are- Providing magnifiers; Simple, bold and large text, Highlighting, Contrast between print and paper background (example: black text, white paper)
-   Provide extensions to assignment/Projects etc. deadlines.

## For Learners with Visual Impairment(Blindness):

Much like with learners with low vision, totally blind learners also face fatigue, and so, take extra time to complete examination, projects or assignments. Therefore, some of same considerations apply, but here are some more:

-   Provide an alternate way of assessment (oral assessments, non-written exams)
-   Provide a scribe.
-   Give the examination orally and record it with a print out or recorded audio. – Extra time for completion of task.

## For Learners with Hearing Impairment:

Some Considerations are as follows-

-   Provide alternatives to oral viva’s questionnaire-based assignments.
-   Provide clear and simple feedback to the learners both verbally and in writing.
-   Learners may require the use of a dictionary during exams.
-   Keep examination instructions clear and short. Use simple language
-   Avoid jargon unless it is crucial to the inherent requirements of the exam.
-   Provide extra time in examination, particularly extra time for reading questions. Some learners will prefer to have questions and instructions ‘signed’ to them.
-   Arrange an alternative exam format (e.g. replacing short answer questions with multiple choice questions).

## For Learners with Learning Disability:

Some considerations are as follows:

-   Allow extensions to assignment deadlines.
-   Allow learners to submit an early draft of assignments to allow the opportunity for feedback to the learner as a formative process.
-   Ensure extra time in examination for reading and analyzing questions, and for planning their answers. Assessment venue must be quiet and distraction-free.
-   Keep short written examination instructions and sentences within examination questions. Questions using bullet points, lists or distinct parts are more likely to be correctly interpreted.

Assessment is a prime tool for monitoring progress and shaping learning during the teaching course and can be conducted through both formal and informal activities. As for as assessment in Mathematics is concerned; it is the process of identifying, gathering and interpreting information about learners’ mathematical learning. Continuous assessment of learners’ work not only facilitates their learning of Mathematics but also enhances their confidence in application of learning Mathematics. The Continuous and Comprehensive Evaluation enables the learners to be evaluated throughout the term and at the end of term also.
