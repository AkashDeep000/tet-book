## Models of the Teaching Mathematics

1.  **Classroom Interaction Analysis (Flanders Interaction Analysis Category System) And Its Implications in Learning Mathematics**

Flander’s Interaction Analysis Category System (FIACS) Flanders developed a system of interaction analysis to study what is happening in a classroom when a teacher teaches. It is known as Flanders Interaction Analysis Categories System (FIACS). Flanders and others developed this system at the University of Minnesota, U.S.A. between 1955 and 1960. Flanders classified total verbal behaviour into 10 categories. Verbal behaviour comprises teacher talk, student talk and silence or confusion. There are ten categories mentioned in this analysis. They are

**Teacher’s Talk – 7 Categories**

(a)   Indirect talk

(b)  Direct talk.

**Category:**

1.  Accepts Feelings
2.  Praise or Encouragement
3.  Accepts or Uses ideas of Pupils
4.  Asking Questions
5.  Lecture
6.  Giving Directions
7.  Criticizing or Justifying Authority

**Pupil Talk -2 Categories**

8.  Pupil Talk Response Category
9.  Pupil Talk Initiation Neither Teacher Talk nor Pupil Talk – 1 Category

**Silence or Pause or Confusion -3 Category**

## Meaning of various categories

1.  **Teacher Talk (7 Categories)**

**(A) Indirect Talk**

In this method of analysis, the first four categories represent the teacher’s indirect Influence.

**Category 1: Accepts Feelings**

-   In this category, teacher accepts the feelings of the pupils.
-   He feels himself that the pupils should not be punished for exhibiting his feelings.
-   Feelings may be positive or negative.

**Category 2: Praise or Encouragement**

-   Teacher praises or encourages student action or behaviour.
-   When a student gives answer to the question asked by the teacher, the teacher gives positive reinforcement by saying words like good, very good, better, correct, excellent, carry on, etc.

**Category 3: Accepts or Uses ideas of Pupils**

-   It is just like 1st category. But in this category, the pupils’ ideas are accepted only and not his feelings.
-   If a pupil passes on some suggestions, then the teacher may repeat in nutshell in his own style or words.
-   The teacher can say, I understand what you mean etc. Or the teacher clarifies, builds or develops ideas or suggestions given by a student

**Category 4: Asking Questions**

**Category 10:** Silence or Pause or Confusion

## Advantages of FIACS

1.  It is an effective tool/instrument to measure the social-emotional climate in the classroom.
2.  It is also used for in-service teachers.
3.  It provides feedback to the pupil-teachers.
4.  It is an objective and reliable method for observation of classroom teaching.
5.  It is mostly teacher talk oriented.
6.  It is used to compare the behaviour of teachers at different age levels, gender, subject etc. 7. It is much useful in team teaching and microteaching.
